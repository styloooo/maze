This program generates a random maze and then solves it. For the maze code, please look at maze.cpp.
The program solves all possible paths to the bottom and shows the solution for the longest path among all available options in the bottom row.
My initial solution for solving is commented out at the end of the file. I came up with the better solution later but let the original remain in the comments.
